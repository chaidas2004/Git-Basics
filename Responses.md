The core princples that revolve around Git and GIthub is verison control, a collobarative workspace, and project management. Its easier for developers to keep track of changes to their code over time through a dedicated repository, as working on certain features or debugging code can be done by branching off the main. Github refers to the cloud computing aspect, which allows for the pratice of bringing other partners to work on a dedicated project, seeing the progress, milestones, etc. Its very transparent and accessible to collobrators about what needs to be done and the current state of the application/project.Through a series of commands, my work can be viewed and altered in a sort of sandbox envoirment without affecting the main component, I believe this is benefical to minimize ineffiencies and losses of coding errors, crashes, etc. Its localized to one particular branch, so I will take this newfound knowledge and apply it to my project.
